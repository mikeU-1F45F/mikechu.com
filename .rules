# Mike Chu Portfolio - AI Assistant Rules

## Project Overview
- Portfolio website for Mike Chu, a Staff Software Engineer
- Showcases professional journey across three eras: past, present, and future
- Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum performance
- Hosted on Cloudflare Pages

## Comments
- Avoid adding internal / inline comments in all file types
- Use descriptive function & variables names or otherwise semantic tags
- Use comments only for JavaScript where there are non-obvious decisions / concise solutions in place

## Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces for HTML, 2 spaces for CSS/JS)
- Follow camelCase naming for JavaScript variables and functions
- Prefer CSS classes with BEM naming convention (block__element--modifier)
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Maintain semantic HTML structure with proper ARIA attributes

## Architecture
- The site uses an era-based navigation concept (past/present/future)
- Main JavaScript functionality in `src/scripts/main.js`
- Main CSS is in `src/styles/main.css`
- Break out and import CSS modules, JavaScript scripts and HTML componentsfor better organization
- No build process - files are served directly without bundling
- Development server runs with Deno

## Performance Guidelines
- Minimize DOM manipulations and batch changes when possible
- Use CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations where feasible
- Implement debouncing for scroll and resize event handlers
- Follow progressive enhancement principles

## Accessibility Requirements
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout the site
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Include proper ARIA roles, states, and properties
- Support screen readers with appropriate announcements

## Development Workflow
- Use the Deno development server for local testing
- Always search the code base for existing functions, components, and styles before implementing new features
- Use version control (Git) for collaboration and history tracking
- Write conventional commit messages
